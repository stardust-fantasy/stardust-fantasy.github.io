            i'm leaf- well, that's a username, but you can call me that. <br>
            my hobbies mainly consist of programming, albeit a skill that's dwindled for me the older i've
            gotten. i started out at the age of 9 or so learning javascript, then i got incredibly skilled 
            at python. as a few years went by i didn't do much programming due to school becoming more intense, 
            but then i discovered something. minecraft, one of the most popular and one of my favorite games,
            had something called "datapacks" in it. these were basically built-in modifications to the game that 
            somewhat resembled programming, albeit a form of it that creates many bad habits.
            <br>
            now, fast forward 3 years later, and here i am. i no longer actively make datapacks, and i'm 
            trying to work my way back up to where i was. 3 years doing nothing but that one hobby was really 
            detrimental to the knowledge, and if i want to do this type of thing for a career, i need to retain 
            that knowledge.
            <br>
